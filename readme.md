# PLEASE GO TO [THE ORGANIZATION](https://github.com/anti-grass/)

this is just to go along with the grass games ive made, and every other anti grass product (if you can call it a product lmao) ive made and will make. if you dont trust the releases, look through the source code, and download the source code and run the unpacked extension. if you still dont trust it, dont use it, simple as that.
